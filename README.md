## Description
Our program is based on an ab initio protein folding prediction method described by Thachuk C. et al.
It allows to determine a 2D and semi-3D folding by a simple evaluation of energy functions. It is a program
interpreted on the Python 3 version and is exploitable on any type of operating system.
## Usage
A set of test data is available on the `test` folder
### Install the program
    1. Download the programm on https://github.com/Moohmoo/REMC 2. `cd src` 3. `python3 parser.py -h`
